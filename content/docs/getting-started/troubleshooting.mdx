## Loading Video Stream Issue

The most common issue with JetKVM is getting stuck at "Loading video stream..." when trying to connect to your device. This problem is typically caused by WebRTC connection issues between your browser and the JetKVM device.

### 1. Update JetKVM Firmware

- Navigate to the IP address displayed on your JetKVM device
- Go to Settings → Check for Updates
- If an update is available, apply it and check if the issue is resolved

### 2. Verify WebRTC Functionality

- Temporarily disable all browser extensions that might block or alter WebRTC connections
- If using a VPN or corporate network, try temporarily disconnecting as these can block WebRTC traffic

### 3. Browser-Specific Settings

**For Chromium:**
- Navigate to `chrome://flags/#webrtc-ip-handling-policy` in your address bar
- Look for "WebRTC IP Policy"
- If it's set to "Disable non proxied UDP", change it to "Default"
- Restart your browser for the changes to take effect

**For Microsoft Edge:**

- In your address bar, enter `edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay`
- Ensure your JetKVM URL is in the Allow list, as Edge may block autoplay by default

**For Vivaldi:**

- Navigate to `vivaldi://flags/#ignore-gpu-blocklist`
- Enable "Override software rendering list" (ignore the GPU blocklist)
- Go to Vivaldi Settings → Webpages and ensure "Use hardware acceleration when available" is enabled
- Make sure "Broadcast IP for best WebRTC Performance" is enabled
- Restart the browser after making these changes

**For Firefox:**

- Navigate to `about:config`
- Search for `media.peerconnection.enabled`
- Set it to `true`
- Restart the browser after making these changes

### 4. Check Browser Autoplay Settings

- As noted by some users, browsers may block video autoplay by default
- Ensure autoplay settings for video/audio are enabled for the JetKVM site

### When will I receive my JetKVM?

**We don't know.** We understand the wait can be frustrating, but rest assured, we are working around the clock to get your packages out.

For more context:

As the delivery of your JetKVM pledge depends on so many factors, **mostly out of our control**, we can only provide you with a rough estimate of the dispatch of your device.

<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 shadow-sm text-blue-500 px-3 py-[2px] my-0 rounded-md">

Before proceding, make sure you know [which batch you are
in](/docs/getting-started/ks-faq#which-batch-am-i-in)!

</div>

**December, January, February Batch:** Less than 0.25% of these batches are still pending. These are mostly orders requiring manual handling due to unusual delivery requirements. If you haven't received a shipping email, please [contact us](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com).

**March Batch:** We began processing the March batch on March 18th. About 10% of this group has already been dispatched, and more are going out each day. Things are moving consistently now.

**April Batch:** We expect the April batch to start shipping in April. No delays expected.

**If you're in the March or April batch, please don’t email us just to ask for a status update.** You can check your reward’s progress any time via the [Pledge Tracker](https://shiphelp.jetkvm.com). Just enter your email, and you’ll see where your reward is in the shipping pipeline.

**Important Reminders:**

- Shipments go out **continuously starting in the target month**, not all at once.
- Extensions will **likely ship separately** from your main device.

### Which batch am I in?

The batch you're in depends on the backer number, **and not when you backed the project.**

- **December**: Less than 12208
- **January**: 12208 - 15303
- **February**: 15304 - 19415
- **March**: 19416 - 30447
- **April**: Larger than 30447

### How do I know when my package will be dispatched?

Once a package is dispatched from the factory in Shenzhen, China, you will receive an email at the shipping email address you provided in the backer survey. Please ensure you've completed the survey.

We will also send you updates via email as your package makes its way to you. A tracking link will be provided once the reward has been handed over to the local courier.

If you haven't received an email, it means your reward hasn't been shipped yet.

### Kickstarter vs. Retail

JetKVM remains a Kickstarter-backed project, meaning delivery timelines are estimates rather than fixed retail shipping dates. We are preparing for retail availability, but we are not there yet.

Your support made this product possible, and we appreciate your patience as we work to deliver it to you.

### I entered the wrong shipping country during my pledge

If you selected the incorrect shipping country when making your Kickstarter pledge and are now unable to correctly complete the backer survey, please contact our shipping team at [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com).
We'll help resolve this issue and ensure your shipping details are properly updated.

### Can I still make a pledge?

**Yes!**

You can make a late pledge to the campaign on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm?ref=5sxcqi).
Rewards from late pledges will be part of a March 2025 batch of devices.

### Will there be a retail version of JetKVM? How much will it cost?

**Yes**, we're currently in talks with Amazon to sell the JetKVM.

We plan to **keep the $69 price**, before shipping and taxes.
The final price will vary based on your location and available shipping options.

### I never provided my shipping address. How do I do that?

To ensure everything is properly tracked in Kickstarter's system, you'll need to submit your address through the Kickstarter backer survey.

You should have received an email with the survey link, but you can also access it directly here: [Kickstarter Survey Link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jetkvm/jetkvm/backing/survey_responses) (make sure you're logged into the correct Kickstarter account).

This process helps us stay organized and ensures your JetKVM is shipped to the right place!

### What courier will you use?

Unfortunately, we can't specify the courier for any country, as shipping is handled by a third-party service rather than directly by us. If this is a critical requirement for you, and you'd like a refund, please reach out to [shipping@jetkvm.com](mailto:shipping@jetkvm.com). When we go retail in March, details like this will be much clearer.

### Will you be able to handle the demand?

**Yes!**

Batch production has been happening throughout November 2024, and we have secured the components needed to meet the
projected order volume.

### Can I change my pledge?

Unfortunately, we're unable to make changes to pledges after they've been submitted. The pledge you made is final and cannot be modified, even at the shipping stage.

However, you have a few options:

1. **Refund and Reback**: I could refund your pledge, and you could back the project again with updated items. Please note that this may result in a later shipping date, so be sure to check the Expected Delivery date.
2. **New Account Option**: If you don't mind paying extra for shipping, you can create a new Kickstarter account and back the project again with the updated items.
3. **Wait for Retail**: Alternatively, if you're not in a rush, we plan to launch the product for retail on platforms like Amazon starting in February. This might be a more convenient option.

Reach out to [contact@jetkvm.com](mailto:contact@jetkvm.com) if you'd like to discuss these options.

### Can I edit my shipping address?

Prior to shipping your reward, we'll send you an email to verify your shipping address. You'll be able to review, edit, and confirm your address at that time.
